# Overview

LessonLink is a web application that allows music teachers and their students to manage records of their private music lessons. It includes features for scheduling lessons - with the option to sync events with Google Calendar - as well as tracking payments, uploading and sharing documents, posting assignments, tracking attendance, and more. The project was initially created in a 10-day sprint for my final "Capstone" project as a student of devCodeCamp.
